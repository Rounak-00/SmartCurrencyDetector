# Currency Recognition System

## Overview
This project is a currency recognition system built using Django for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The system utilizes deep learning models trained using transfer learning and fine-tuning on VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNet. The trained models are used to classify Indian currency notes and provide audio feedback for visually impaired users, making it easier for them to identify currency notes independently.

The highest accuracy achieved was 97% using ResNet, which is the model being used for currency detection.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to **assist visually impaired individuals** in identifying Indian currency notes quickly and accurately using a deep learning-based recognition system. By integrating **audio feedback**, the system enables users to hear the denomination of the detected currency, helping them in their daily transactions without relying on others.

## Features
- **Live Camera Capture**: Users can capture an image using their webcam.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image for currency recognition.
- **Currency Detection**: The system processes the image and identifies the currency.
- **Audio Feedback**: A detected currency note's value is converted to audio output.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: Tensorflow, Keras, Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, EfficientNet)
- **API Communication**: JavaScript (POST request to Django backend)

## Model Training
The dataset used for training was downloaded from Kaggle:
```
kaggle datasets download -d vishalmane109/indian-currency-note-images-dataset-2020
```
The models were trained on Kaggle using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques. The final trained models were saved in `.keras` format under the `models/` directory.

## How It Works
1. **Frontend Interaction**: The user either captures an image using their webcam or uploads an image.
2. **API Request**: The image is sent to the Django backend via a POST request.
3. **Currency Detection**: The backend processes the image using `CheckCurrency.py`.
4. **Audio Feedback**: `TextToAudio.py` converts the detected currency note's value into an audio response.
5. **Response to Frontend**: The resultant audio is played.

## API Details
- **Endpoint**: `POST /upload/`
- **Handled in**: `urls.py -> upload in views.py`
- **Request Body**: FormData containing the uploaded image
- **Response**: JSON with detected currency and an audio response

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rounak-00/SmartCurrencyDetector.git
   cd SmartCurrencyDetector
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Django server:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
4. Open the application in your browser: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy with additional training data.
- Deploy the system for real-time mobile application use.
- Implement support for multiple currencies.
